###   DECISION MAKING: PROTOTYPE 2   ###
========================================

* The ORGANISM consists of a set of NODES.

* Each NODE has two slots, where each slots affects one FACTOR (O.C.E.A.N.). A node factor value (NFV) is a value between 0 and 100.

* Each FACTOR obtains its value by inserting all node values for that factor into an algorithm.

* The overall state is obtained by inserting the set of factor values into an algorithm.

* In an iteration, the ORGANISM compares two of its nodes, and for each iteration must perform one of the following actions:
	1. Move a value of 1 from one NODE to the other. The affected slots must affect the same FACTOR.
	2. Merge the two nodes using a merge algorithm. This is automatically followed by a new node being spawned.
	3. Destroy both nodes if neither 1. or 2. improves the overall state. This is automatically followed by two new nodes being spawned.
